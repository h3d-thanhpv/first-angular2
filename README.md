### Demo first app for angular 2

0.1. Install node and npm on windows
--------------------

Update npm to lastest version on windows: Run powershell as administrator

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force
npm install -g npm-windows-upgrade
npm-windows-upgrade
```

0.2. Install dependency library

If the `typings` folder doesn't show up after running npm install, you'll need to install it manually with the command:
